For over 5 years, OCSS has striven to provide friendly and engaging opportunities for computing students at the University of Otago. We now consist of approximately 100 members who enjoy participating in a variety of events â€” from BBQs to career expos. The club has also previously collaborated with organisations such as the School of Computing, the Career Development Centre and private companies. We are always looking to increase the variety of events we offer, so if you have any ideas or would like to work together, then please get in touch!

Our 2024 exec team includes:
- President: Niamh Avery
- Treasurer: Thomas Prior
- Secretary: Shyamalima (Shreya) Das
- IT Manager: Aaron Rumpler
- General Executive: Jackson Kelly
