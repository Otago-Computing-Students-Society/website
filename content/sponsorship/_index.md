We are always looking to connect our members with firms and other organisations within the industry. As such, we can work with you and can give your organisation the chance to meet some of computing's best new talent - our members are diverse, skilful and enthusiastic about their fields of study (which include majors such as Computer Science, Information Science, Data Science and Software Engineering).

Our club is also flexible and can support your organisation in a variety of ways, depending on what suits you best. For example, this could take the form of: 
- A collaborative event, such as an in-person office tour or virtual workshop
- Advertising for a company information event or job postings
- Your logo on our merch and/or posters
- A representative from your organisation speaking at one of our events

A prospectus covering all of our basic sponsorship options can be found [here](test.com). Alternatively, if you would like a different arrangement then please do not hesitate to [email us](contact@ocss.nz).
